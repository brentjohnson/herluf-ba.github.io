> This is part 2 of 3 in a tutorial series about making a turn-based online multiplayer game in Rust. In this series we will be building a small game called TicTacTussle. In this post we will use the reducer pattern that was introduced in the [previous post](https://herluf-ba/herluf-ba.github.io/making-a-turn-based-multiplayer-game-in-rust-01-whats-a-turn-based-game-anyway), to write a server for our game. In the [third and final post](https://herluf-ba.github.io/making-a-turn-based-multiplayer-game-in-rust-03-writing-a-client-using-bevy) we will write a client for the game using the awesome Bevy game engine.

Welcome back! ðŸ‘‹ In this post we will use the reducer pattern to write our game server. Let's just get started right away!

## A good starting point
To get straight into the intresting bits of the project I've prepared a template for us to use. It sits in a branch of the tic-tac-tussle respository, so it's easy to clone like this:
```bash
git clone -b template https://github.com/herluf-ba/tic-tac-tussle.git
# Or however you like to do your clonin' (you can use the zip-download, I won't judge ðŸ‘€)
```
The template is a [cargo workspace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html) with two binaries `client` and `server` and a library they both use called `store`. All three has a `Cargo.toml` file with the necessary dependencies already added to them as well as an empty `src/[main/lib].rs`. The `client` also has some assets for us to use, once we get around to writing that in the next post.
```text
tic-tac-tussle/
â”œâ”€â”€ client/
|   â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
|   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/*
|   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ main.rs
â”œâ”€â”€ server/
|   â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
|   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ main.rs
â”œâ”€â”€ store/
|   â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
|   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ lib.rs
```

## What's next?
That's it for this post. In the next one, we will write a client application using the [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/) so we can finally play a round of TicTacTussle!
