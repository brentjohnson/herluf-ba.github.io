> This is part 2 of 3 in a tutorial series about making a turn-based online multiplayer game in Rust. In this series we will be building a small game called TicTacTussle. In this post we will use the reducer pattern that was introduced in the previous post, to write a server for our game. In the [third and final post](TODO) we will write a client for the game using the awesome Bevy game engine.

TODO: Write post

## What's next?
That's it for this post. In the next one, we will write a client application using the [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/) so we can finally play a round of TicTacTussle!

Thank you for reading! If you see something that's wrong, I would appreciate it very much if you would [make a pull request](https://github.com/herluf-ba/herluf-ba.github.io/pulls).
