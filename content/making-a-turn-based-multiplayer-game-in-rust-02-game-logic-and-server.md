> This is part 2/3 in a tutorial series about making a turn-based online multiplayer game in Rust. In this series we will be building a small game called TicTacTussle. This post descripes what we are trying to achieve, and presents a way to design our code to support that. In the [first post](TODO) TODO and in the [third and final post](TODO) we will write a client for the game using the awesome Bevy game engine.



## What's next?
That's it for this post. In the next one, we will setup a Rust workspace, write the server for our game and adapt our gamestate implementation into a library that the server can use. You can already [read part 3 here](TODO) ðŸ•º

Thank you for reading! If you see something that's wrong, I would appreciate it very much if you would [make a pull request](TODO). If you want to talk to me [I'd love to receive an email](mailto:herlufbaggesen13@gmail.com), but I'm also sporatically active on the [Bevy Discord](https://discord.gg/bevy)
